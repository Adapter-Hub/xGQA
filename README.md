# xGQA
This reporistory contains the test-dev data of the paper ["xGQA: Cross-lingual Visual Question Answering"](https://arxiv.org/).

## Overview
The repository is structured as follows:
- **`data/zero_shot/`** contains the xGQA test-dev files for all 8 languages
- **`data/few_shot/`** contains the new standard splits for few shot learning. The number in the file name indicates how many distinct images the split includes. i.e. `train_10.json` implies that this subset contains questions about 10 distinct images.
